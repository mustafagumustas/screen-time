# Face Recognition and Screen Time Calculation

This is a Python program that takes a video or webcam as input, recognizes faces, assigns unique ID numbers to each person in every other scene, and calculates their screen time.

## Installation

To run this program, you will need to install Python 3 and the following libraries:
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (optional, if you plan to use machine learning algorithms for face clustering or classification)

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn

## Usage

The program will display the output in real time, showing the detected faces, their assigned ID numbers, and their screen time.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the OpenCV documentation and the work of various face recognition and tracking researchers.

If you use this program in your research or project, please consider citing this repository as a reference.
